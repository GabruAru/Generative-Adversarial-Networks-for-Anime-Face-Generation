**Generative Modeling**

Deep neural networks are predominantly employed for supervised learning tasks like classification or regression. In contrast, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have a distinct objective: generative modeling.

Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning endeavor in machine learning, where the primary aim is to grasp and capture the inherent patterns and structures within the input data. The model learns to represent the data distribution in such a manner that it can generate novel examples that closely resemble those present in the original dataset. This process involves automatically discovering the underlying regularities, allowing the model to produce new plausible samples that could feasibly have been drawn from the actual data.

In the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), two key neural networks coexist: the Generator and the Discriminator. These networks engage in a competitive and cooperative dance during training.

The Generator's role is to create synthetic data samples, referred to as "fake" samples. It takes a random vector or matrix as input and crafts data points that imitate the original training dataset. Meanwhile, the Discriminator operates as a discerning critic. Its task is to examine a given sample and classify it as either "real" if it belongs to the training data or "fake" if it originates from the Generator.

The training process unfolds in a back-and-forth manner. First, we train the Discriminator for a few epochs, guiding it to become better at distinguishing between real and fake samples. Then, we shift our focus to the Generator and train it for a few epochs to improve its ability to generate more realistic and convincing fake samples.

As this iterative training cycle repeats, both the Generator and the Discriminator learn and evolve their strategies. The Generator strives to produce more authentic-looking samples, attempting to fool the Discriminator, while the Discriminator hones its ability to make accurate judgments about the origin of the presented samples.

This dynamic competition drives both networks to improve continuously until the Generator can create synthetic samples that are so realistic that the Discriminator can barely distinguish them from real data. The final outcome is a Generator capable of generating high-quality, plausible data samples that closely resemble the original training dataset.



Here is the results from model after each epoch.
